5. Once activated, you’ll receive a code on your phone each time you log in, which you will need to enter along with your password.

#### **Why You Should Enable 2FA**:
- **Increased Security**: Even if your password is compromised, the hacker would need access to your phone to log in.
- **Peace of Mind**: You’ll be notified if someone tries to access your account from an unrecognized device.
